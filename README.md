I am S.Balasubramanian.
I am persuing B.E. Computer Science Engineering in Veltech MultiTech Dr.Rangarajan Dr.Sakunthala Engeneering College.
Here  we use Multi layer perceptron for crime prediction.
This project aims on crime prediction for improving safety of an individual.
We  have three layers.
We  can create separate networks for sevaral cities and train them.
Input  layer  having 5 nodes - minutes,hours,day,month and year.
One middle layer having 10 nodes.
The output laver have variable number of nodes depending upon the number of crimes happenning in each city.
