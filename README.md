# CrimePrediction
Here  we use Multi layer perceptron for crime prediction.
We  have three layers.
We  can create separate networks for sevaral cities and train them.
Input  layer  having 5 nodes - minutes,hours,day,month and year.
One middle layer having 10 nodes.
The output laver have variable number of nodes depending upon the number of crimes happenning in each city.
